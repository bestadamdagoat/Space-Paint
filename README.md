# Space-Paint
This is the repository for Space Paint. 
Do not download Space Paint from here. 
This is only for people to make remixes of the code. 
Use Gamemaker Studio 1.4 to edit this. 
Give credit if you upload your own version of Space Paint.
This application is only for Windows.
Do not change the license. The license states that you have to use the same license (i might be thinking about the creative commons license but still).
I will make a Discord soon so we can easily manage everything.
